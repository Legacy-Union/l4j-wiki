# Legacy4J/Re-Console wiki
## About the project
This project is designed to be a wiki page for the official [Legacy4J modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacy-minecraft) aka Re-Console.
It is also under **HEAVY** development as of right now. Please do not treat this like a finished product!

# Todo
- [X] Example for advertisements (unobtrusive)
- [X] button sounds
- [ ] main page rework

# Software Used
## [PHP Markdown Lib](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/)

This is used for the blogposts and wiki.

The blog is so that the less html inclined can use it, the wiki is for me to be lazy and easily import .md files.
