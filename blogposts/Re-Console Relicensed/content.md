Hello!

As of May 17th 2024, Re-Console has made the decision to relicense itself.
This comes after a specific project was found on Modrinth that was a near 1-1 re-upload of Re-Console; barring 6 mods added (half of which being libraries)

The relicense is more-so a protective measure than anything; as the new license forces forks to be FOSS software, of which the modpack that initiated this change was not.

## How does this affect the user?
Not at all! Nothing will change for the user end. Development will continue as normal

## How does this affect devs?
Well; if you intend to build off of Re-Console past 0.3.3, you must disclose your source openly (such as the configuration files), state your notable changes, and more.
For a simplified explanation, I reccomend quickly reviewing [this page](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-gpl-3) for a quick overview of what you can and cannot do.

Thanks for reading!
