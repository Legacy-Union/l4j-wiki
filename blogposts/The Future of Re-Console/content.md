# The Future of Re-Console
Hello everybody, it's omoso

This may come as a surprise, but as of May 31st 2024, I have decided to step away from Re-Console, it's development, and Minecraft modding as a whole for the foreseeable future. 
This is coming after a long streak of disappointing events regarding Re-Console, the LCE community, and Minecraft as a whole.

The LCE community has shown itself draining to my mental health to an extent where merely maintaining the modpack is causing me stress.

## Who will maintain Re-Console in your absence?
I will finalize the modpack developer applications some-time next week. Whoever is picked at that point will be considered as the new maintainers of the modpack, which will still be supervised by me to an extent.

## When will you be back?
I'm entirely unsure. I may be back in a month or two, or 3 or 6, but I may never be back. It all depends on my personal well-being and quality of life.

Thanks for reading.
