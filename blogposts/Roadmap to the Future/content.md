Hello!

With our new maintainer (say hi to Devin :D), we've finally set up a roadmap for what will happen in the future regarding Re-Console!
This contains a list of features, plans, and generally what we want to do with the project in the future.

### To note: these planned features have ***no*** ETA's. They will be releasing when they are ready!


## Planned Features
- Clean up the options.txt file
- Remove unneeded mods that no longer have a purpose, to increase speed of updating to new versions and less incompatibilities 
- Port to Neoforge sometime during 1.21.x
- Provide a more stable and faster experience for most users, stepping away from more experimental optimizations
- Provide proper documentation on how to configure, how to install and some optional mods that could be added
