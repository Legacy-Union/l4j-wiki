Hello everybody, it's omoso.
I am coming here today to make a statement on uBlock Origin's recent blocking of advertising links regarding Server Hosting companies.

For those unaware, as of today, uBlock Origin decided to block all advertisements regarding Server Hosting banners/links on Modrinth.
As a partner of BisectHosting, which is directly affected, this change comes across as unreasonable and beyond what an Adblocker should do, for a few reasons.

### 1. Policing User Generated Content
This change opens up the flood gates for User Generated Content to be blocked by uBlock in a blanket manner, which leaves no exceptions and pages/things broken.
This could include affiliate links regarding stuff like Amazon broken in Youtube descriptions, simply because it has an affiliate link. To further elaborate, thats what most of these server hosting companies do for partnerships.

### 2. Hurting Small Creators
UBlock is going out of their way to target the few ways that creators have for making revenue.
These blockers dont block ads from a single entity providing them, they block thousands of individuals posting a banner on their page to get some monetary return from their project..

This is a step *beyond* what an adblocker should do.

### Invasive
Coming off of my last point, this change also leaves room open for invasive filters.
Let's say one of your friends messaged you, asking "what server host do you reccomend?", and you said one of the hosts on the uBlock filter. 

That message will appear blank for anyone using uBlock. Out of all sites, they also targeted Modrinth over Curseforge. Modrinth is known to host smaller or independent creators, and this is a step in the wrong direction.

### Ending Notes
This blog post doesn't seek to say "stop using uBlock!", more so seeking to get the point across that this decision was a mistake, hurts independent creators and directly attacks UGC.
Some independent creators are the ones making this mod, Legacy4J, and both developers of Re-Console. All of us (Wily, Devin and me) are partners to a host which uBlock directly targets.

Thank you for reading.
