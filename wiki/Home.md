**Welcome to the Legacy4J Wiki!**  

First of all, the main focus of this Wiki is for developers, as most of the functionality of this mod comes from the Legacy Console Edition


# Basic Concepts

The basic changes that this mod brings to Minecraft are mainly visual, so for this reason I will focus in the following topics on the changes made to the general functioning of the game, both client-side and server-side.

* Skip the intro by pressing the RETURN key or the down button (right with the Invert Buttons option active) on a controller
* Delete and rename saves/servers by pressing O or the up button (left with the Invert Buttons option active) on a controller
* The resource packs selected on the Create World/Load Save Screen will be saved in the level data, and will be selected every time you enter the world again
* The additional Load Save screen can be disabled with the Load Save Directly option in the Game Options section
* Villagers now have locked trades, you can see the level at which it was/will be unlocked in the left recess panel, this means you can see future trades, remembering that it does not work on servers without the mod, along with auto trade, so you will have to take the item and manually place it in the trade slots with the fake items
* The Crafting Interface can be disabled with the Classic Crafting option in the User Interface section, remembering that it doesn't work on servers without the mod anyway
* The Legacy Creative screen can be disabled using the option of the same name in the User interface section, remembering that you can access the tabs of other mods by changing the current page
